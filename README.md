# HSTRec: Hierarchical Semantic Transformer-based Recommendation Framework

This repository contains the source code and sample data for the paper:

**"HSTRec: A Hierarchical Semantic Transformer-Based Recommender System for Sparse User-Item Environments"**

---

##  Overview

HSTRec is a hybrid recommendation model that integrates:

- Semantic movie embeddings (from BERT)
- Hierarchical clustering on movie content and ratings
- Cluster-aware user profiling
- Transformer encoder for user-item interaction modeling
- Hybrid loss function combining MSE and similarity loss

The framework is tested on the MovieLens-100K dataset and achieves state-of-the-art results in rating prediction.
